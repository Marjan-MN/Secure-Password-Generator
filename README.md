# Secure-Password-Generator

## Description

The password generation app is a practical and interactive tool designed to help users create strong and secure passwords. The app utilizes prompts to gather specific information from the user, such as password length, and character types. Based on these inputs, the app generates a random password that meets the user's criteria. The generated password is then displayed on the screen, ready to be copied and used for various accounts and online services.

Throughout the development of this project, I learned several valuable skills and concepts in JavaScript programming, and provided me with hands-on experience in JavaScript programming, allowing me to enhance my skills in user interaction, randomization, string manipulation, conditional statements, error handling, and potentially UI design. These skills are valuable not only for this project but also for future endeavors in web development and software engineering.
